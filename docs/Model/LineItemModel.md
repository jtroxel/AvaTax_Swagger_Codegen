This quantity value should always be a positive value representing the quantity of product that changed hands, even when handling returns or refunds.                If not provided, or if set to zero, the quantity value is assumed to be one (1). | [optional]

If you set this value to &#x60;null&#x60;, or if you omit this element from your API call, then instead the transaction  will use the &#x60;addresses&#x60; from the document level.                If you specify any other value besides &#x60;null&#x60;, only addresses specified for this line will be used for this line. | [optional]

**exemption_code** | **string** | The customer Tax Id Number (tax_number) associated with a certificate - Sales tax calculation requests first determine if there is an applicable  ECMS entry available, and will utilize it for exemption processing. If no applicable ECMS entry is available, the AvaTax service  will determine if an Exemption Number field is populated or an Entity/Use Code is included in the sales tax calculation request,  and will perform exemption processing using either of those two options.  Note: This is same as &#39;exemptNo&#39; in TransactionModel. | [optional]
