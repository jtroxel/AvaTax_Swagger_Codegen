/**
 * CompanyDistanceThresholdModelTest Class Doc Comment
 *
 * @category    Class
 * @description A company-distance-threshold model indicates the distance between a company  and the taxing borders of various countries.  Distance thresholds are necessary  to correctly calculate some value-added taxes.                Distance thresholds only apply to sales of goods in certain countries.  A distance threshold  is applied for each ship-from/ship-to combination of countries.  The threshold amount is defined by  the ship-to country.                Generally, if you have exceeded a distance threshold for taxes between a pair of countries, your tax calculation  will be determined to be the rate in the destination country.  If you have not exceeded the threshold,  your tax calculation will be determined to be the rate in the origin country.                The amount of a threshold is not tracked or managed in AvaTax, but the decision of your tax compliance department  as to whether you have exceeded this threshold is maintained in this object.                By default, you are considered to have exceeded tax thresholds. If you wish to change this default, you can create  a company-distance-threshold object to select the correct behavior for this origin/destination tax calculation process.
